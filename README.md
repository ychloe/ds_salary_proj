# Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview 
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 
* Used Flask to turn the model into an API endpoint that takes in job posting data and returns an expected salary.

## Web Scraping
Tweaked the web scraper github repo (above) to scrape 1000 job postings from glassdoor.com. With each job, we got the following:

*	Job Description
*	Rating
*	Company 
*	Location
*	Company Headquarters 
*	Company Size
*	Company Founded Date
*	Type of Ownership
